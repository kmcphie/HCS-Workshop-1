## Katherine McPhie

This website was created as part of a Harvard Computer Society Bootcamp. Here is a summary of the things that I added.

### Personalized website

I added a photo of myself and my bio to the About tab and included links to my Instagram, GitHub, and LinkedIn in the Navigation Bar.

### Added div onClick to About Tab

In the About tab you can click to reveal contact information now.

### Added Education Tab

I created an Education tab and listed my education there the way it would be listed on a resume.

### Added Projects

I added links and brief descriptions of projects I am currently working on to the Projects tab.

### Added Descriptions to Experience Tab

I added a descriptions to each of the things in the Experience tab so that when you click on one, not only does it show up bigger on the highlighted portion, but more information about the experience also shows up below that.
